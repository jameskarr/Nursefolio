# Secured Health
Designed to aid medical personnel with tracking their personal documents for employers. Shot records, certifications, and licenses expire at different times and keeping those items organized can be difficult. With a user login experience, you can upload a photo with notes and access them on any device at any time.

**Live demo available:** https://securedhealth.cyclic.app/

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** MongoDB, EJS, Express.js, Node.js, & Tailwind

This full stack application was designed using the commonly known architectural pattern, MVC. Beginning with the Model, schemas were created to represent the collection of users and their documents within MongoDB. Cloudinary was integrated for users to upload, store, manage, manipulate, and deliver their images. Then, the users documents in mongoDB are rendered for the user to View with EJS. Next, the Controllers were fashioned to allow user and database manipulation.

## Optimizations

Add routes to edit title of images
